## Antons notes
One needs to have docker-compose installed to run this application.
Run this to start the application:
```bash
docker-compuse up
```
This will start two different docker containers. One containing the database, and one hosting the webapplication.

There is a chance that you might have to specify new paths in the dockerfile to get this to run correctly
